# VehiCrypto
This project is a simple reflex-based game called *Push and Perish, developed using the MSP430G2553* microcontroller. Players must watch the countdown on a 7-segment display and press a button at the right time to win.

## Game Rules:
- Countdown: The 7-segment display counts down from 3, 2, 1, 0.
- Winning Conditions:
  - If a player presses the button before reaching 0, the other player automatically wins.
  - If both players wait until 0 and then press, the first player to press wins.
- LED Indicators:
  - The winning player’s LED lights up.
- Game Restart:
  - After determining a winner, the game waits 3 seconds and restarts automatically.
